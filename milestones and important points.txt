In this project I'm building an ultimate authentication system using MERN stack i.e. MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js. 
I've built a production ready complete authentication system which has
email activation logging with Facebook, log in with Google, forgot password 
and we have even created private and protected routes.

We have created the middleware in the back end.

We have protected the bases in the funding.

installed packages in the backened/server:
(1) Express
(2) Nodemon
(3) body-parser
(4) cors
(5) dotenv
(6) express-jwt
(7) express-validator
(8) google-auth-library
(9) jsonwebtoken
(10) mongoose
(11) morgan
(12) @sendgrid/mail
(13) crypto: it's the core node.js module to hash the password for better security. We can use bcrypt also.
(14) js-cookie
